Abstract: 
We discuss weighted least squares estimates of ill-conditioned linear inverse problems where weights
are chosen to be inverse error covariance matrices. Least squares estimators are the maximum likelihood estimate for normally distributed data and parameters, but here we do not assume particular
probability distributions. Weights for the estimator are found by ensuring its minimum follows a
Ï‡^2 distribution. Previous work with this approach has shown that the it is competitive with regularization methods such as the L-curve and Generalized Cross Validation (GCV) [23]. In this work
we extend the method to find diagonal weighting matrices, rather than a scalar regularization parameter. Diagonal weighting matrices are advantageous because they give piecewise smooth least
squares estimates and hence are a mechanism through which least squares can be used to estimate
discontinuous parameters. This is explained by viewing least squares estimation as a constrained
optimization problem. Results with diagonal weighting matrices are given for a benchmark discontinuous inverse problem from [15]. In addition, the method is used to estimate soil moisture from
data collected in the Dry Creek Watershed near Boise, Idaho. Parameter estimates are found that
combine two different types of measurements, and weighting matrices are found that incorporate
uncertainty due to spatial variation so that the parameters can be used over larger scales than those
that were measured.
