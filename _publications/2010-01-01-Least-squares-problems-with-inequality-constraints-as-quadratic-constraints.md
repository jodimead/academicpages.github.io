Abstract:
Linear least squares problems with box constraints are commonly solved to find model parameters within bounds
based on physical considerations. Common algorithms include Bounded Variable Least Squares (BVLS) and the
Matlab function lsqlin. Here, we formulate the box constraints as quadratic constraints, and solve the corresponding
unconstrained regularized least squares problem. Box constraints as quadratic constraints is an efficient approach
because the optimization problem has a known unique solution.
The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is investigated through solving three benchmark problems and one
from a hydrological application. Results are compared with solutions found by lsqlin, and the quadraticaly constrained formulation is solved using the L-curve, maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP), and the χ^2
regularization
methods. The χ^2
regularization method with quadratic constraints is the most effective method for solving least
squares problems with box constraints.
