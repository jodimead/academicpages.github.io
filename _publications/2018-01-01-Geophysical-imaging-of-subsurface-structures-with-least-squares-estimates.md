Abstract:
Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is a useful tool for subsurface imaging.
However, the resulting nonlinear inverse problem is severely under-determined.
Smoothness constraints are commonly implemented with least squares to make the
problem solvable, but the constraints limit the ability to produce discontinuities in
the model parameters. In practice, sharp delineations have been recovered with these
constraints by applying appropriate weights or covariance matrices which relax the
constraint at different regions [10, 14, 15, 19, 26]. For example in medical imaging,
anatomical information has been included in electrical impedance tomography (EIT)
through matrix valued fields [3, 4, 16]. More closely related to this work, prior
structural information was added to ERT inversion through matrix valued fields [12].
In this work, we analyze the binary matrix that relaxes the smoothness constraint
in locations where there is a known boundary. Analysis of the recovered parameters
using this matrix gives insight as to the type of heterogeneities that can be recovered.
We conclude that it is more effective to include structural information with 1st and
2
nd order derivative constraints than with initial parameter estimates. In addition,
we show that the 1st derivative constraint produces models with piecewise constant
variability, while a 2nd derivative will yield linear variability. These conclusions are
verified on synthetic ERT inversions in seven different subsurface structures.
