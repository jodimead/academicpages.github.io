Abstract:
Conglomeratic alluvial sediments (sand–gravel–cobbles) are common
in fluvial, periglacial, and tectonically active regions but have received
little attention with respect to unsaturated flow, specifically moisture–tension–conductivity relationships, due to difficulty in making measurements in
the field or laboratory and lack of agricultural value. We used a field-scale
infiltration experiment, a one-dimensional layered forward model, and
parameter estimation modeling to examine in situ flow behavior between
residual and partial saturation in a four-layer system under steady infiltration (0.84 cm h^−1) for 19 h. Prior information from ground-penetrating radar,
grain-size distributions from core samples, and long-term tension (y) and
moisture (q) monitoring were used to define geologic structure, simulate
test behavior, and provide initial parameter estimates. Vertically distributed
measurements of y(t) and q(t) from the experiment were matched using
four parameters (qs, a, n, and Ks) of the van Genuchten–Mualem (VGM)
relationships for each material layer and a Metropolis–Hastings (MH) search
with multiple, independent-chain runs to 106 samples each. Scale reduction
factors indicated convergence of independent chains for 11 of 16 parameters. Final distributions of individual parameters varied from normal to nearly
uniform distributions, and some parameter pairs showed high cross-correlation (R2 > 0.9). Results showed that (i) VGM relationships can be applied to
these coarse, conglomeratic soils to characterize unsaturated flow behavior
across the natural range of partial saturation, (ii) even under high sustained
infiltration rates, these coarse conglomeratic soils remain well drained,
despite relatively low porosity and significant cobble fraction, and (iii) high
uncertainty and nonconvergence of MH chains does not lead to significant
misfit of the observed data. These findings imply that a significant cobble
fraction does not markedly reduce infiltration at low saturation levels that
develop under natural recharge conditions.
