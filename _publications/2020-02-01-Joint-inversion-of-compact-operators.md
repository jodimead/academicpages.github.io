Abstract: 
Joint inversion of multiple data types was studied as early as 1975,
where authors used the singular value decomposition to determine the degree of illconditioning of joint inverse problems. The authors demonstrated in several examples
that combining two physical models in a joint inversion, and effectively stacking discrete
linear models, improved the conditioning of individual inversions. This work extends
the notion of using the singular value decomposition to determine the conditioning of
discrete joint inversion to using the singular value expansion to determining the wellposedness of joint operators. We provide a convergent technique for approximating the
singular values of continuous joint operators. In the case of self-adjoint operators, we
give an algebraic expression for the joint singular values in terms of the singular values
of the individual operators. This expression allows us to show that while rare, there
are situations where ill-posedness may be not improved through joint inversion and
in fact can degrade the conditioning of an individual inversion. We give an example
of improving inversion with two moderately ill-posed Greenâ€™s function solutions, and
quantify the improvement over individual inversions. Results from this work show that
analysis of singular values of compact operators describing different data types before
an inversion helps identify which types of data are advantageous to combine in a joint
inversion.
